# My-New-Setup-Steps

I often need to do a fresh install of my system for reasons.
With this project, I plan to save time and compile all of the steps I usually take into a guide and bash scripts.

This plan includes:
- Arch Linux installation steps with the BTRFS filesystem
- Git and Git LFS setup
- Desktop Environment installation (Gnome/KDE/Xfce)
- Installation of packages I use often
- Optimus-manager setup for a Nvidia discrete graphics card.
