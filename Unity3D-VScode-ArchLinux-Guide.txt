I managed to make it work and do my Unity development on Linux, but right now, I can only build for Linux platforms.

1.  Install Unity Hub through the official website

2.  Install Visual Studio Code
  sudo pacman -S code
  
3.  In Unityhub, connect to your account, activate your license,
configure your editor's path, and install the latest editor.

4. Open VScode and install the following extensions useful for C# and Unity
  - Unity Debugger
  - Unity Tools
  - Unity Code Snippets
  - C#
  - vscode-solution-explorer
  Close VScode when done

5. Install .Net
  sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk
  
6.  Install mono and other complementary packages
  sudo pacman -S mono mono-tools mono-msbuild mono-msbuild-sdkresolver mono-addins

7. Force programs to use mono frameworks
sudo echo "FrameworkPathOverride=/lib/mono/4.7.1-api/" >> /etc/environment

8. Through Unityhub, open a project or create a new one and go to 
   'Edit>Preferences>External Tools' and point the editor to 'usr/bin/code'

9. Open the C# project and test if Intellisense works

9.1. If Omnisharp is still showing errors when opening vscode, go back in 'External tools'
    and try regenerating the assembly files'.
